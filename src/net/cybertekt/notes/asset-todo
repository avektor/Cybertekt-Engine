Asset Manager Todo:

	Continue testing concurrency. ****
        Test asset tracking capabilities
	Finish Documenting.
        Need to fix abort/cancel methods.
        

AM CHANGES:
    Asset Manager is now thread-safe and its methods can be called from any thread.
    Added automatic status tracking via getCompleted(), getSubmitted(), getActive() methods.
    Added reset() method to reset the number of submitted/completed tasks. 
Loading assets concurrently (6 threads) take ~3.3ms per PNG file.

Maybe look into using a work stealing pool instead of a fixed-size pool.

AppStates should have a load() method that shows a loading screen while assets are loaded concurrently by the asset manager.
