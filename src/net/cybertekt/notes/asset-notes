WAS WORKING ON DOING registerLoader(Loader.class)
	-need to call threadPool.submit(loaders.get().newInstance())

CREATE A CACHE FOR EACH REGISTERED FILE TYPE EXTENSION TO IMPROVE SEARCH TIME?

NEED TO ADD 'RELOAD' BOOLEAN PARAMETER TO ALL ASSET MANAGER LOAD() AND GET() OPERATIONS.

NEED TO GO BACK THROUGH CODE AND REMOVE ANY STRING CONCATENATION. USE LOGGER FOR ERRORS.
        -WHEREVER THERE IS AN EXCEPTION, LOG AN ERROR AND RETURN A SINGLE STRING AS THE EXCEPTION MSG.

ASSET CACHE
    -AssetManager.createCache ??
        -REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS HARD.


NEED TO FIX OR REMOVE (PROB REMOVE) ASSET MANAGER STAT TRACKING ATOMIC INTEGERS
    -ACTUALLY, THE PURPOSE OF THE ATOMIC COUNTERS SHOULD BE FOR TRACKING TASKS, NOT ASSETS.
    -TO TRACK ASSETS, AN ASSETCACHE SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD.

NEED TO REMOVE THE BUILD CODE THAT IS COPYING THE ASSETS DIRECTORY TO THE BUILD DIRECTORY ?

ADD COMMENT - ALL ASSETS SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO BE IMMUTABLE.

MAKE OGLSHADER ASSET IMMUTABLE

NEED TO REDESIGN OGLSHADER TO BE A SINGLE OBJECT THAT REFERENCES A SINGLE .GLS FILE

SHADER LOADING FAILS WHEN LOADED VIA ASSETMANAGER.LOAD() BECAUSE THE LOADING HAPPENS IN A NEW THREAD.

Changes:

    AssetManager
        -Fixed how Assets are loaded. Assets are no longer loaded from the classpath by the classpath loader and the base Assets directory has been changed to 
        System.getProperty("user.dir").replace('\\', '/') + "/assets/"
        -Added method for loading multiple Assets with a single call.

    Image
        -Made the Image asset class immutable.
