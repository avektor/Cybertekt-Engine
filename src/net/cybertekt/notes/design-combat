Combat Modules
    A combat module is a cybernaut component that contains a set of combat functions. The function capacity of a module depends on the skill level of its creator. 
    Premade modules can be created, trade, and sold by players. More advanced modules have a higher function capacity and may even be capable of storing multiple sets.
